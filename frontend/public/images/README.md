# Images Directory

## Background Image

Place your panther background image here with the filename: `panther-background.jpg`

The image should be:
- High resolution (1920x1080 or higher recommended)
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- The image will be used as the home page background

## Current Setup

The home page is configured to use `/images/panther-background.jpg` as the background image.

If you need to change the filename, update the `background-image` property in:
- `frontend/src/pages/Page.css` (line 22)
